== Introduction

GradTrak is an application designed for students of National University of Singapore (NUS) to easily track their graduation progress.
The current version of the application offers graduation requirement tracking to Computer Science majors (namely the Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering Focus Areas).
Stay tuned as we will be adding other courses in the near future!

Users can interact with the application by entering commands into the command box. This will benefit Computer Science majors as they can generally type quickly.

.. Module Panel: You can view the details of the modules that you have taken
or are planning to take.

.  To access a feature of the application, type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it.
For example, typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. You might wish to set the course of study first. There are currently 3 courses available in this app: Computer Science Algorithms,
Computer Science Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Software Engineering.
To set the course, enter one of the following commands:
`study Computer Science Algorithms`, `study Computer Science Software Engineering` or `study Computer Science Artificial Intelligence`.
.  Here are some commands you can try:
* **`add`**`c/CS1010 s/Y1S1` : adds the module "CS1010", taken in Y1S1, into the module plan.
* **`delete`**`1` : deletes the first module on the most recently displayed list.
* **`displayreq`**: displays information on your course requirements and the percentage completed for each requirement.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

Here we only introduced some of the more basic functions and commands of GradTrak. The following section, <<Features>>,
will give you a more detailed guide/walk through for each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user, e.g. in `add c/MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/cs1010`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `c/MODULE_CODE [g/GRADE_OBTAINED]` can be used as `c/CS1010 g/A` or as `c/CS1010`.
====

[[add]]
=== Add module: `add`

Adds a module to GradTrak based on the given module code, semester taken and expected / obtained grade. +
Format: `add c/MODULE_CODE s/SEMESTER [min/NEW_EXPECTED_MIN_GRADE] [max/NEW_EXPECTED_MAX_GRADE] [lec/NEW_LECTURE_HOURS] [tut/NEW_TUTORIAL_HOURS] [lab/NEW_LAB_HOURS] [proj/NEW_PROJ_HOURS] [prep/NEW_PREP_HOURS]` +
or +
`add c/MODULE_CODE s/SEMESTER [g/NEW_EXPECTED_MIN_GRADE NEW_EXPECTED_MAX_GRADE] [lec/NEW_LECTURE_HOURS] [tut/NEW_TUTORIAL_HOURS] [lab/NEW_LAB_HOURS] [proj/NEW_PROJ_HOURS] [prep/NEW_PREP_HOURS]`

****
* Possible grade options are the standard letter grades (A_PLUS, A, A_MINUS, B_PLUS, B, B_MINUS etc.) and IC, EXE, CS, CU, W, S, U.
* You cannot add an existing module with the same semester.
* You can only add a module if you have previously added its prerequisites.
****

Examples:

* `add c/CS2103T s/Y2S2` +
Adds CS2103T, to be taken in Y2S2, to the module plan.

* `add c/CS2103T s/Y2S2 max/B_MINUS` +
Adds CS2103T, to be taken in Y2S2 with expected max grade B-, to the module plan.

=== Listing all modules in module plan: `cklimit`

Calculates the expected total workload and expected min and max CAP of each semester and checks against the limit set by the user. +
Format: `cklimit`

=== Clear all data entered: `clear`

Deletes all the added modules. +
Format: `clear`

=== Sets the current semester: `cursem`

Indicates that the previous semesters must have a single finalized grade in the expected grade range. +
Format: `cursem`

=== Delete module: `delete`

Removes a module from GradTrak based on module code or index in the most recently displayed list. +
Format: `delete INDEX` +
or +
`delete c/MODULE_CODE`

****
* Shows a message if the given module code is not found.
****

Examples:

* `delete c/CS2103T` +
Deletes CS2103T from GradTrak.
* `delete 1` +
Deletes the first module on the most recently displayed list.

=== Display module information: `displaymod`

The `displaymod` command shows all modules that is available in NUS based on the user's search. This command simply
shows modules straight from NUS's database of modules and does not check if the user has met the prerequisites to read
a particular module.

This command will allow users to find out more about a module or even compare modules so as to decide which modules to read
in the upcoming semesters. Once decided on which module the user plans to read, they can use <<add>> command to add the
module to their own list.

[NOTE]
Searches are *case-insensitive*.

[WARNING]
Users must strictly adhere to syntax of the `displaymod` command in order to get optimum search results.


There are *2* ways to search for modules:

* Search by *code*:
All modules have module code associated with it, this makes it easier to remember modules.To search for modules based on
code, a `c/` prefix must be added after `displaymod` command, followed by a list of modules which are separated by `,`. +
Format: `displaymod c/MODULE_CODE,[MODULE_CODE]

.Single module code search command format +
image::displaymod1cexamplecmd.png[width="500"]

The search above should yield a result: +

.Single module code search result +
image::displaymod1cexampleresult.png[width="800"]

However if users wishes to search for multiple modules at once they can follow the example given below: +

.Multiple module codes search command format +
image::displaymodMcexamplecmd.png[width="500"]

The search above should yield a result: +

.Multiple module code search result +
image::displaymodMcexampleresult.png[width="800"]

* Search by *name*:
There are cases where students may not remember or know a module's code but vaguely remember the module's name. Users
who find themselves in such a situation can search for modules by their names by adding a `n/` prefix after the
`displaymod` command, followed by keyword/s that can be found in the module's name. Keywords have to be separated by `+`
symbol. +
Format: `displaymod n/KEYWORD+[KEYWORD]`


.Single module name search command format
image::displaymod1nexamplecmd.png[width="500"]

The search above should yield a result: +


.Single module name search command result +
image::displaymod1nexampleresult.png[width="800"]

However if users wishes to search for multiple modules at once they can follow the example given below: +

.Multiple module name keyword search format +
image::displaymodMnexamplecmd.png[width="500"]

The search above should yield a result: +

.Multiple module name keyword search result +
image::displaymodMnexampleresult.png[width="800"]

If the user has successfully managed to display a module of their choice, they will be presented with module/s containing
several information that the user will find useful. The example below will show the information provided for each module
after a successful search:

.What information each module contains
image::displaymoddisplay.png[width="800"]

* 1. Shows the module *code* and module *name*.
* 2. Shows which department the module belongs to.
* 3. Displays the amount of module credits a student can gain by reading this module.
* 4. Displays a brief description of the modules and potentially the topics that may be covered.
* 5. Contains the prerequisite tree for each module.
* 6. Contains workload load information, the values are meant to be read as *Hours*.



// tag::Displayreq[]
=== Display Course Requirements: `displayreq`
One of the core functions of GradTrak is to track whether the user has fulfilled his/her degree requirement.
As of `v1.3` of the application, GradTrak currently only has course information of 3 Computer Science major Focus Areas, namely:

* Algorithms
* Artificial Intelligence
* Software Engineering

You may refer to the guide on `study` command to understand how to set your current course of study.

Using the information of the modules the user has already taken or is planning to take in the future semesters,
this command informs the user whether they have completed a certain Graduation / Course Requirement. If a certain requirement is not completed, this command will also inform the user an approximate degree of completion of the requirement and also
at the same time, suggest some other modules offered by NUS which they can take to fulfill the requirement.

Format: `displayreq`

// end::Displayreq[]

=== Edit module: `edit`

Edits the semester or grade of a module in the module plan based on module code or index in the most recently displayed list. +
